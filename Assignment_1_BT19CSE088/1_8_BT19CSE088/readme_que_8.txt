This project contains 3 file:
1) Time.h
2) Time.cpp
3) Time_main.cpp

Time.h:
	This file contains class time's declaration.

Time.cpp:
	This file contains definitions for all member methods declared in time class. They include methods given in question as well as getter and setter methods.

Time_main.cpp:
	This file contains main function in which objects of time class type are defined. In this function we try to find to sum of 2 given time according too clock i.e in clock's constraints of time definition. For this purpose we defined a sum function which add two time, but this function doesn't explicitly give correct result. It uses settime() function to correct the time added as this function implicitly checks all this constraints and corrects it also.
